# Document Gardening

Process for keeping docs in sync with code and maintaining the knowledge base as a **system of record**.

<HARD-GATE>

- Never report "no issues" without actually inspecting docs
- Always perform structural verification (file existence, reference consistency) mechanically
- Always verify fixes before committing
- Never rationalize "unnecessary at this scale" — entropy accumulates regardless of scale
- Never speculatively add rules to knowledge base docs — add only when an agent makes a mistake
- Never put context directly in CLAUDE.md. No exceptions. "It's short", "it's a behavior rule", "this repo is special" are all rationalizations.

</HARD-GATE>

## Part 1: Knowledge Base Design Principles

### CLAUDE.md is a Table of Contents — Not a Context Container

CLAUDE.md (or AGENTS.md) should contain **only a table of contents**. All context for agents to read must live in the `docs/` knowledge base.

| Location | Role |
|----------|------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | ~100-line table of contents. Contains only **conditional triggers** pointing to docs/ files |
| **docs/** | All context. Architecture, conventions, design docs, execution plans, etc. |

**"It's short enough to keep in CLAUDE.md" is a rationalization.** Whether it's a 1-line project overview, 5-line convention, or behavior rule — all context belongs in docs/. CLAUDE.md should only contain triggers pointing to the relevant docs/ file.

### Use Conditional Triggers

Each CLAUDE.md entry must specify **when to read it**. Simple pointers (path + description) won't be read by agents.

```markdown
# ❌ Simple pointer — agents won't read this
## References
- [Architecture Details](docs/architecture.md): Directory structure and layer relationships
- [Conventions](docs/conventions.md): Coding rules and workflows

# ✅ Conditional trigger — agents actually read this
## References
- When understanding project structure → read `docs/architecture.md`
- When adding/modifying skills or plugins → read `docs/conventions.md`
- When checking MCP server integration → see `docs/mcp-servers.md`
- When working on tech debt → check `docs/exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`
```

**The difference**: Simple pointers say "this exists." Conditional triggers say "read this when." Agents act on instructions, not awareness.

### docs/ = System of Record

All context that agents need to read lives here.

```
docs/
├── design-docs/           # Design documents (navigated via index.md)
├── exec-plans/            # Execution plans
│   ├── active/            #   In progress
│   ├── completed/         #   Done
│   └── tech-debt-tracker.md
├── generated/             # Auto-generated docs (DB schemas, etc.)
├── product-specs/         # Product specs
└── references/            # External references (LLM-friendly docs, etc.)
```

### Monorepo Progressive Disclosure

In monorepos, follow the **inheritance model**. Root CLAUDE.md triggers and rules automatically apply to all workspaces. Workspace CLAUDE.md should only add triggers for its own scope — never repeat what's in root.

#### CLAUDE.md Ownership

| Item | Root CLAUDE.md | Workspace CLAUDE.md |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| Shared docs/ triggers | ✅ | ❌ (inherited) |
| Workspace-specific docs/ triggers | ❌ | ✅ |
| Shared behavior rule triggers | ✅ | ❌ (inherited) |
| Workspace-specific rule triggers | ❌ | ✅ |

#### docs/ Ownership Boundaries

```
monorepo/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Shared triggers
├── docs/                  # Shared knowledge base (context needed by 2+ workspaces)
├── apps/
│   ├── web/
│   │   ├── CLAUDE.md      # web-specific triggers
│   │   └── docs/          # web-specific knowledge base
│   └── api/
│       ├── CLAUDE.md
│       └── docs/
└── packages/
    └── ui/
        ├── CLAUDE.md
        └── docs/
```

#### Decision Criteria

"Where does this context/trigger go?"

- **Needed by 2+ workspaces** → Root `docs/` + root CLAUDE.md trigger
- **Needed by 1 workspace only** → That workspace's `docs/` + workspace CLAUDE.md trigger
- **Workspace needs to reference root docs/ file** → Don't add a trigger in workspace CLAUDE.md. It's already inherited from root

```markdown
# ❌ Duplicating root trigger in apps/web/CLAUDE.md
## References
- When understanding project structure → `../../docs/architecture.md`    ← already in root
- When modifying routing logic → read `docs/routing.md`

# ✅ Workspace-specific triggers only
## References
- When modifying routing logic → read `docs/routing.md`
```

### Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Inline context in CLAUDE.md** | Loses table-of-contents role | Move all context to docs/ |
| **Simple pointers** `[Title](path): description` | Agents won't read them | Use conditional triggers `when ~ → path` |
| **200+ line CLAUDE.md** | Context overload | Compress to ~100-line TOC |
| **"Short enough to inline"** | Exceptions pile up into bloat | No exceptions. Everything in docs/ |
| **Speculative rules** | Noise | Add only on agent mistakes. Review for deletion if unviolated for 3 months |
| **Knowledge only in external systems** | Agents can't access it | Encode in repo |
| **Root-workspace trigger duplication** | Fix one, the other drifts | Once in root only. Workspaces inherit |
| **Copying shared rules to workspaces** | Can't stay in sync | Manage in root docs/ |
| **Workspace-specific context in root** | Noise for unrelated workspaces | Move to that workspace's docs/ |

## Part 2: Document Review Workflow

### Document Layers

| Layer | Target Files | Key Question |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **L4: Meta** | `marketplace.json`, `plugin.json` | Machine-parseable? |
| **L3: Skills** | `SKILL.md`, `references/` | Does it drive correct behavior? |
| **L2: AI Context** | `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` | TOC-only structure? Are triggers valid? |
| **L1: Entry Point** | `README.md` | Can someone install and get started? |

### Review Strategy: Delegate to Subagents

If the main agent runs checklists directly, reading many files bloats context and reduces focus. **Delegate verification to subagents; the main agent synthesizes results.**

```
Main Agent                         Subagents
───────────                        ──────────
[0] Check change history via git log
         │
         ├──dispatch──→  SubA: L4 Meta + L3 Skills
         ├──dispatch──→  SubB: L2 AI Context
         └──dispatch──→  SubC: L1 Entry Point + Cross-references
         │
    Collect results (structured report)
         │
[6] Synthesize report & apply fixes
```

**Subagent dispatch rules:**
- Include **repo root path** and **change list from [0]** in each subagent's prompt
- Include the **full checklist** for that layer in each subagent's prompt
- Subagents **read and verify only**. They do not modify files
- Return format: use the `Issues Found` table format from the report template below

**Grouping rationale:**
- **SubA (L4+L3)**: Plugin meta and skill docs share the same directory structure
- **SubB (L2)**: CLAUDE.md verification requires judging TOC structure, consistency, and health — needs a focused agent
- **SubC (L1+cross-refs)**: README and cross-references can be verified by path existence alone, without results from other layers

### [0] Check Change History — Main Agent Executes Directly

Run git log before reviewing. **Do not rely on memory. Always run the commands.**

```bash
# Recent structural changes (files added/deleted/renamed)
git log --oneline --diff-filter=ADR --name-status --since="2 weeks ago"

# Last modified date for each doc (run individually per file)
git log --format='%ar %s' -1 -- CLAUDE.md
git log --format='%ar %s' -1 -- README.md
```

Include these results in subagent prompts. Subagents cross-check whether each change is reflected in docs.

### SubA Checklist: L4 Meta + L3 Skills

**L4: Meta File Verification**

- [ ] Plugin count in `marketplace.json` == actual subdirectory count under `plugins/`
- [ ] Each plugin directory contains `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- [ ] Each plugin directory contains `.mcp.json`
- [ ] `plugin.json` `name` field == directory name
- [ ] `marketplace.json` description semantically matches `plugin.json` description

**L3: Skill Document Verification**

- [ ] Each skill directory under `skills/` contains `SKILL.md`
- [ ] `SKILL.md` has YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
- [ ] Frontmatter `name` == directory name
- [ ] If MCP servers are mentioned, they are defined in `.mcp.json` (excluding built-in tools)
- [ ] All files in `references/` are referenced from `SKILL.md` (no orphan files)
- [ ] All `references/` files referenced in `SKILL.md` actually exist (no broken references)

### SubB Checklist: L2 AI Context

**TOC Structure:**
- [ ] Is CLAUDE.md ~100 lines or fewer?
- [ ] No inline context in CLAUDE.md? (Violation if project overview, architecture, conventions, commands, etc. are written directly)
- [ ] All context lives in docs/ knowledge base?
- [ ] Are docs/ references in conditional trigger format? (`when ~ → path`) — not simple pointers (`[Title](path): description`)?

**Consistency:**
- [ ] Do conditional triggers point to docs/ files that actually exist?
- [ ] Does docs/ content match current codebase structure?
- [ ] Does MCP server list match actual `.mcp.json`?

**Health:**
- [ ] No duplicate triggers between root and workspace CLAUDE.md
- [ ] No speculative rules (rules not responding to actual agent mistakes)
- [ ] Review rules unviolated for 3+ months for deletion

### SubC Checklist: L1 Entry Point + Cross-references

**L1: Entry Point Verification**

- [ ] Plugin list == plugin list in `marketplace.json`
- [ ] Each plugin description semantically matches `plugin.json` `description`
- [ ] Install commands work (correct plugin name, marketplace name)
- [ ] External links are valid (just note existence for auth-required internal URLs)

**Cross-reference Verification**

- [ ] Skills referenced from SKILL.md actually exist
- [ ] CLAUDE.md trigger paths point to docs/ files that actually exist
- [ ] Internal paths referenced from README.md actually exist

### [6] Synthesize Report & Apply Fixes — Main Agent

Synthesize subagent results into a single report.

```markdown
## Document Gardening Report (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Review Scope
- L4 Meta: ✅/❌
- L3 Skills: ✅/❌
- L2 AI Context: ✅/❌
- L1 Entry Point: ✅/❌
- Cross-references: ✅/❌

### Issues Found

| # | Layer | File | Issue | Severity |
|---|-------|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | L2   | CLAUDE.md | Conventions written inline | High |
| 2 | L2   | CLAUDE.md | docs/ references are simple pointers | High |
```

**Severity criteria:**
- **High**: Inline context in CLAUDE.md, conditional triggers not used, agent working with wrong context
- **Medium**: Wrong information for users, affects skill behavior
- **Low**: Formatting inconsistency

**The urge to downgrade severity is itself a Red Flag.** "This repo is special", "this level is fine" are rationalizations. Judge by the criteria.

**Fix principles:**
- **Fix directly**: Structural mismatches (missing file listings, path errors, MCP server lists)
- **Confirm with user first**: Knowledge base structure changes, convention changes
- Re-dispatch the relevant layer's subagent to re-verify after fixes

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Too few files to bother reviewing" | Fewer files = higher impact per error |
| "No structural changes, should be fine" | Run git log. Don't rely on memory |
| "Just need to fix CLAUDE.md" | Always review all layers L4→L3→L2→L1 |
| "This inconsistency is minor" | The urge to downgrade severity is itself a Red Flag |
| "Fixed it, no need to re-verify" | Fixes can introduce new inconsistencies. Re-verify |
| "It's short, keep it in CLAUDE.md" | No exceptions. All context goes in docs/ |
| "Behavior rules belong inline" | Behavior rules go in docs/ too. CLAUDE.md holds triggers only |
| "This repo is special" | No repo is special. Principles are universal |
| "Just listing the docs/ path is enough" | Without conditional triggers, agents won't read it |
| "Better add a rule just in case" | Speculative rules are noise. Add only on mistakes |
| "Copy to all workspaces" | Duplication always drifts |

## Tools

- `Glob`: Check file existence
- `Grep`: Search references in docs, detect duplicate content
- `Read`: Verify doc contents
- `Edit`: Modify docs
- `Bash (git log)`: Last modified dates, structural change history
- `Bash (wc -l)`: Measure CLAUDE.md line count
